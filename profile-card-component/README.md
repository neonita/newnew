## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to add mutiple background images as well as the syntax in styling each background image in different CSS properties. <!-- I learned that I could style each background image with commas as long as its key-value matches the order of background images listed. -->

```html
<div class="container">[...]</div>
```

```css
.container {
  background-image: $bg-desktop-top, $bg-desktop-bottom;
  background-position: left -318px top -530px, right -237px bottom -575px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to practice using the Sass CSS framework. Particularly styling efficiently and using responsive techniques.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Basics: Using Multiple Backgrounds](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-using-multiple-backgrounds/) - This helped me understand how to set mutiple background images and demonstrated how to style both images with varrying properties.
